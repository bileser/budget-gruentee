Find hundrets of green teas from the biggest german speaking shops. Being able to manage updates regularly on the database

No fancy Javascript UI, for the sake of being visible to search engines. 
The app is written in Python 3.7 and uses [Flask, the python micro framework for building web applications.](https://github.com/pallets/flask) and [Jinja Templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/). I had to overcome the strong desire to engineer a complex UI using a modern Javascript framework. But choose the right tool for the job.

There are several spiders to scrape what I idenfified as the biggest german speaking shops f√ºr green tea. A spider follows the informal interface: If a spider object is initialized, it scrapes overview and detail pages to build a data structure which can be obtained by calling `get_products` on the object.

The Flask app is defined in `reloadable_app.py`. The routes are cached and are refreshed when the app reloads. To reload the app the 'hidden' route `/reload` must be called. This might be not ideal. But hey, this is version 1

`manage.py` is used to manage the updates. It can be executed from a cron job to run the spiders every night. The script gathers all the products and updates their prices in the database and deletes products from the database that don't exist any more. Then it reloads the app.

[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) serves as the database layer, especially the ORM part. You can find the model in `model.py`
